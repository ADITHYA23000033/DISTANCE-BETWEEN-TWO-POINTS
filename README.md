# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the point y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5:
At last,print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
~~~
#Program to find the distance between two points.

x_1=10
x_2=4
y_1=6
y_2=2
d=((x_2-x_1)**2+(y_2-y_1)**2)**0.5
print(format(d,".2f"))  
~~~

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the python program to find the distance between two points is successfully executed
